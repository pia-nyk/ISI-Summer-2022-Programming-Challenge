      "content": "At least 26 people have died and four others were injured after a bus in a mountainous region of the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand plunged into a gorge, police and media reports said. The bus was carrying 30 people, including the driver, to Yamunotri, the remote Hindu pilgrimage site in the Himalayan state, when it went off the road on Sunday evening. The accident happened near Damta in Uttarkashi district, about 160km (100 miles) from the state capital Dehradun. The injured persons have been rushed to the nearby medical facilities, district police superintendent Arpan Yaduvanshi said. Yaduvanshi added that rescue workers were still looking for a missing passenger and the death toll may increase further. The bus was carrying 28 tourists from the Panna district in Madhya Pradesh, local media reports said. The picturesque Uttarakhand has some of the holiest Hindu sites and receives millions of pilgrims each year, but has a poorly maintained and notoriously dangerous network of Himalayan roads. Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a compensation of 200,000 Indian rupees ($2,575) each from the Prime Ministers National Relief Fund for the families of those killed in the accident. The injured will receive 50,000 rupees ($644) each. The Prime Minister has announced an ex-gratia of Rs. 2 lakh each from PMNRF for the next of kin of those who lost their lives in the accident in Uttarakhand. The injured would be given Rs. 50,000 each.  PMO India (@PMOIndia) June 5, 2022  Indias home minister Amit Shah said he was in touch with the local authorities about the ongoing relief work for the very sad incident. Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said the state administration and rescue teams are on the scene. Dhamis Madhya Pradesh counterpart Shivraj Singh Chouhan called the incident unfortunate and said he is in constant touch with the Uttarakhand government and district administration. Arrangements are being made for the treatment of the injured and bringing the bodies of the deceased to Madhya Pradesh. The families should not consider themselves alone in this time of crisis. We all are with the grieving families, he tweeted."

      "content": "An international diplomatic storm has engulfed Indias ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the party of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, following the sanctioning of two party spokespersons over insulting remarks the pair are reported to have made towards Prophet Muhammad. BJP national spokeswoman Nupur Sharma was suspended from the partys primary membership on Sunday for comments made in a recent television debate, while the BJPs Delhi media operation head Naveen Kumar Jindal was also expelled, according to BJP documents and media reports. Sharma is reported to have insulted the prophet and his wife Aisha in a TV debate last week. Following an outcry over the comments made during the debate, Sharmas colleague Jindal is reported to have posted a now-deleted tweet about the prophet that also angered many. The remarks have been blamed for clashes in an Indian state and have also prompted demands for the spokeswomans arrest in India. Indias ambassadors to Kuwait and Qatar were summoned on Sunday to receive official notes of protest over the comments, and Pakistans ministry of foreign affairs issued a statement condemning the highly derogatory remarks and the BJPs response. These totally unacceptable remarks have not only deeply hurt the sentiments of the people of Pakistan but of billions of Muslims around the world, the foreign ministry said in a statement. BJPs attempted clarification and belated and perfunctory disciplinary action against these individuals cannot assuage the pain and anguish they have caused to the Muslim world, the ministry said. Qatars Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the Indian ambassador to present an official note expressing the disappointment of the State of Qatar and its total rejection and condemnation to the controversial remarks, the QNA state news agency reported. While welcoming the BJP statement and suspension of staff, Qatar is expecting a public apology and condemnation of the remarks by the government of India. The State of Qatar calls on the Indian government to immediately condemn these remarks and publicly apologise to all Muslims around the world, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Majed Mohammed Al Ansari said. Spokesperson for Ministry of Foreign Affairs @majedalansari : Qatar Demands Public Apology from Indian Government for Remarks of Official in Ruling Party Against Prophet Mohammed#MOFAQatar pic.twitter.com/NnN1khKw6X  Ministry of Foreign Affairs  Qatar (@MofaQatar_EN) June 5, 2022  Kuwait also summoned the Indian ambassador and said it had handed the ambassador a protest note in which Kuwait rejected and denounced the statements made by the BJP official, Reuters reported. The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation  the second-largest intergovernmental organisation in the world after the United Nations, with a collective population reaching over 1.8 billion  also added its voice to the condemnation. The General Secretariat of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation expresses its strong condemnation and denunciation of the recent insults issued by an official in the ruling party in India towards the Prophet Muhammad, Peace Be Upon Him, the 57-member state organisation said in a statement. Saudi Arabia condemned the remarks, describing the spokespersons comments as insulting and calling for respect for beliefs and religions, according to a foreign ministry statement. Delhi-based journalist Saba Naqvi told Al Jazeera that the BJP had previously benefitted politically from mobilisation against Muslims in India. But in this instance, there has been an international price to pay, Naqvi said. India has one of the worlds largest Muslim populations, so it has come to the notice of the world that this is happening, she said. In a statement on Sunday, the BJP said it respects all religions and strongly denounces insult of any religious personalities of any religion. The Bharatiya Janata Party is also strongly against any ideology which insults or demeans any sect or religion. The BJP does not promote such people or philosophy, the party said. Indias Constitution gives right to every citizen to practice any religion of his/her choice and to honour and respect every religion. The statement did not directly reference the insulting remarks or the sanctioning of the two party officials. The controversy has raised the ire of social media users in Arab countries who have called for a boycott of Indian products, denounced the escalation of hatred against Islam and Muslims, and accused India of following in the footsteps of France and China in promoting Islamophobia. In April, the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) urged the US Department of State for the third straight year to place Indiaon a list of countries of particular concern in terms of religious freedom. The independent bipartisan panel accused India of engaging in and tolerating systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom. During the year, the Indian government escalated its promotion and enforcement of policiesincluding those promoting a Hindu-nationalist agendathat negatively affect Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Dalits, and other religious minorities, the commission said in its annual report (PDF). In its statement, Pakistans foreign ministry said it was also deeply concerned at the alarming rise in communal violence and hatred directed against the Muslims in India. Pakistans former Prime Minister Imran Khan also weighed in on the controversy, accusing the Modi government of being allowed to get away with its Islamophobic policies. Strongly condemn the hateful attack by a BJP spokesperson on our beloved Holy Prophet PBUH. Modi govt has been deliberately following a policy of provocation & hatred towards Muslims in India including inciting vigilante violence against them.  Imran Khan (@ImranKhanPTI) June 5, 2022  Qatars Assistant Foreign Minister Lolwah al-Khater also said that Islamophobic discourse has reached dangerous levels in India  a country well known for its diversity and coexistence. Hate speech against Muslims in India needs to be officially confronted, al-Khater said. The Islamophobic discourse has reached dangerous levels in a country long known for its diversity & coexistence. Unless officially & systemically confronted, the systemic hate speech targeting #Islam in #India will be considered a deliberate insult against the 2 billion Muslims. https://t.co/YcYyAoZcE3    Lolwah Alkhater (@Lolwah_Alkhater) June 5, 2022  In a tweet on Sunday, the BJPs suspended spokeswoman Sharma responded to the controversy saying that she had said things in response to comments made about a Hindu god but it was never an intention to hurt anyones religious feelings, and that she wanted to unconditionally withdraw my statement. In a subsequent tweet, Sharma said that a security threat had been made against her family. Reuters news agency reported that Jindal, her colleague who was expelled by the party, said on Twitter that he had questioned some comments made against Hindu gods: I only questioned them but that does not mean I am against any religion."

      "content": "India has defended its record on religious tolerance and rebuked the United States for its own rights issues after a report accused Indian officials of supporting attacks on minority worshippers. Washingtons annual report on religious freedom around the world contained a rare  if indirect  criticism of New Delhi, its emerging ally, on Thursday, documenting incendiary comments by Indian public officials and accounts of discrimination against Muslims and Christians in India. New Delhis foreign ministry spokesman Arindam Bagchi said on Friday that senior US officials had made ill-informed and biased comments coinciding with the reports release. As a naturally pluralistic society, India values religious freedom and human rights, Bagchi said in a statement. In our discussions with the US, we have regularly highlighted issues of concern there, including racially and ethnically motivated attacks, hate crimes and gun violence, he said. Our response to media queries regarding the release of U.S. State Department 2021 Report on International Religious Freedom:https://t.co/zlwdjgzoOn pic.twitter.com/rBkJaVpxq5  Arindam Bagchi (@MEAIndia) June 3, 2022  Like its neighbour China, India frequently bristles at foreign criticism of its rights record. New Delhi has routinely denounced the US Commission on International Religious Freedom, an autonomous government panel, which has repeatedly recommended India be put on a blacklist. The State Department is highly unlikely to take action against India, identified by successive US administrations as a key strategic partner in the face of a rising China. The report on religious freedom globally in 2021 said attacks on members of minority communities, including killings, assaults, and intimidation, occurred throughout last year in India. These included cow vigilantism  assaults on non-Hindus for allegedly slaughtering cows or trading in beef. Many Hindus, who account for about 80 percent of Indias 1.35 billion people, consider cows sacred and several states ruled by Prime Minister Narendra Modis Hindu nationalist party have enacted laws or toughened old ones against slaughtering cows. Modis Hindu nationalist government has also championed a series of measures that critics have called discriminatory. In India, some officials are ignoring or even supporting rising attacks on people and places of worship, Rashad Hussain, the US ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom, said at the reports launch on Thursday. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the report showed religious freedom and the rights of religious minorities were under threat around the world. For example, in India, the worlds largest democracy and home to a great diversity of faiths, weve seen rising attacks on people and places of worship, Blinken said."

In a statement posted on Twitter on Friday, Indias foreign ministry spokesman Arindam Bagchi said the comments made by the US official were ill-informed. It is unfortunate that vote bank politics is being practiced in international relations, he wrote. We would urge that assessments based on motivated inputs and biased views be avoided. India frequently denounces the US Commission on International Religious Freedom, an autonomous government panel which has repeatedly recommended that the State Department put India on a blacklist. The State Department did not announce new designations on Thursday and it is highly unlikely that it would take action against India, identified by successive US administrations as a key global partner in the face of a rising China. The BJP government, however, has been accused of championing a series of measures that critics have called discriminatory against the minorities, mainly Muslims. The party denies the allegations."

      "content": "A team of Indian officials has met the acting foreign minister of Afghanistan to discuss bilateral ties and humanitarian aid, the Taliban said, in what was the first such visit to Kabul since the group took control of the country last year. Poverty and hunger have rocketed in Afghanistan since the Taliban took power after the United States pulled out, and India has sent food grains and other aid. The Taliban administrations acting foreign minister, Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi, met an Indian foreign ministry delegation led by JP Singh, a secretary in the ministry. The meeting focused on India-Afghan diplomatic relations, bilateral trade and humanitarian aid, Taliban foreign ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi said on Twitter. Balkhi said the minister called the visit a good beginning in ties between the two countries. Per Taliban spox, India's joint secretary JP Singh met \"foreign minister\" Amir Khan Muttaqi & discussed diplomatic relations, trade & humanitarian aid. Muttaqi described visit of Indian team as a \"good start\". pic.twitter.com/yR5aY2ouqI  Rezaul Hasan Laskar (@Rezhasan) June 2, 2022  India has no formal diplomatic ties with the Taliban government, but its envoys have previously met Taliban representatives in Doha, the capital of Qatar, where the group has an office. Asked if New Delhi now officially recognised the Taliban administration, Indian foreign ministry spokesman Arindam Bagchi told reporters they were reading far too much into the visit. The ministry earlier said in a statement the officials would oversee the delivery of humanitarian assistance and visit areas targeted by Indian-backed programmes or projects. India has donated about 20,000 tonnes of wheat, 13 tonnes of medicines, 500,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine, and items of winter clothing, with more medicine and food grains on the way, it said. India pulled its officials out of Afghanistan last August and closed its embassy, although it is keen to retain ties with the country where its regional rival Pakistan wields considerable influence. Bagchi declined to say when the embassy might be reopened, except to say that local staff had continued to function and ensure proper maintenance and upkeep of its premises there. Muttaqi expressed gratitude for the Indian humanitarian and medical assistance to Afghanistan, stressing the importance of the resumption of projects by India, its diplomatic presence in Afghanistan and the provision of consular services to Afghans, particularly to Afghan students and patients, Balkhi said. Before the Taliban took control, India provided Afghan security forces with training and military equipment but had no troops on the ground. It was also the regions largest provider of development aid to Afghanistan."

      "img_caption": "China has rejected 'slanderous attacks' about conditions for Muslim Uighurs and other minorities living in its Xinjiang region [File: Ozan Kose/AFP]",
      "content": "China provides a glaring example of how governments are cracking down on religious minorities, a US official has said, as the Department of State released its annual report on religious freedom around the world. Rashad Hussain, the US ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom, said during a news conference on Thursday that far too many governments remain undeterred of their repression of their citizens. It comes as no surprise that the Peoples Republic of China is a glaring example here, he told reporters. The PRC government continue[s] to commit genocide and crimes against humanity against Uighurs, who are predominantly Muslim, and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups. A day before US President Joe Biden took office, Washington announced it had determined Beijing was committing genocide and crimes against humanity against Uighurs in the western province of Xinjiang, where rights groups and witnesses have said more than one million people are being held in internment camps. China initially denied the existence of any detention camps in Xinjiang, but in 2018, said it had set up vocational training centres necessary to curb what it said was terrorism, separatism and religious radicalism in the region. The Chinese government has rejected abuse allegations, decrying slanderous attacks about conditions for Uighurs and other religious minorities in Xinjiang. China continues its genocide and repression of predominantly Muslim Uighurs and other religious minority groups, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday at the news conference unveiling the 2021 International Religious Freedom Report. Since April 2017, more than one million Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz and others have been detained in internment camps in Xinjiang, he said. The Department of States report also accused the Chinese government of asserting control over and restricting the activities and personal freedom of religious adherents that it perceived as threatening state or [Chinese Community Party] interests. NGOs and media continued to report deaths in custody and that the government tortured, physically abused, arrested, disappeared, detained, sentenced to prison, subjected to forced labor and forced indoctrination in CCP ideology, and harassed adherents of both registered and unregistered religious groups for activities related to their religious beliefs and practices, it read. The Department of States report also detailed religious freedom in India, a longstanding US ally and the worlds largest democracy  but a nation that experts and rights monitors said has seen deteriorating human rights conditionsin recent years. Attacks on members of religious minority communities, including killings, assaults, and intimidation, occurred throughout the year, the report found, pointing to incidents of cow vigilantism against non-Hindus, as well as threats, attacks and incitement against Christians and Muslims. It also said Hindu and Sikh civilians were killed in Indian-administered Kashmir in attacks that caused widespread fear and forced hundreds to flee. Ten of 28 states have laws restricting religious conversions. Four state governments have laws imposing penalties against so-called forced religious conversions for the purpose of marriage, the report found. The findings came weeks after a separate US panel urged the Department of State for the third straight year to place India on the US list of countries of particular concern, saying religious freedom had significantly worsened in the country in 2021. The US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) accused India of engaging in and tolerating systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom and pursuing policies that negatively affect Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Dalits, and other religious minorities (PDF). Ambassador Hussain also voiced concern in February about a contentious ban on the headscarf at schools and colleges in Indias southern state of Karnataka. That criticism prompted a strong rebuttal from the Indian government, which has also rejected US reports on human rights and religious freedom in India in the past as interference in the countrys internal affairs. Since coming into office, the Biden administration has stressed the importance of Washingtons relationship with New Delhi, and senior American officials held virtual talks with their Indian counterparts in April. However, ties have been tested most recently by Indias purchases of Russian energy supplies amid the war in Ukraine, with Biden telling Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the US could help India diversify its oil supplies  but to avoid increasing Russian imports."
